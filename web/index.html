        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE <br>
        Version 3, 29 June 2007 <br> </code> <br> <br>

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/> <br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies <br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. <br>
 
             Preamble <br>

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for <br>
software and other kinds of works. <br>

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed <br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, <br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to <br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free <br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the <br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to <br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to <br>
your programs, too. <br>

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not <br> 
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you <br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for <br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you <br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new <br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things. <br>

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you <br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have <br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if <br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. <br>

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether <br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same <br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive <br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they <br>
know their rights. <br>
